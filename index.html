        <div class="about column animated-element">
            <img src="images/image_05.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                I am an enthusiast Web Developer and a Computer Science Student. I liked computer from the very
                begining.
                I mean who hasn't. All of us have liked it espacially my Generation. Where computer is in the hand of
                almost
                every person in the form of Mobile. Watching Ironman the AI and stuff was like a miracle for me but
                As I grew up I started researching about the topic through which I got to know about the fact that it's
                just all about programming. Giving instructions to the computer Simply telling it what to do. And that
                was the day
                I grew my intrest in the feild of Computer Science.
            </p>

        <div class="about animated-element">
            <img src="images/image_04.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                And Hence I started my journey. Now in the begining I was not into web development that
                much. I wanted to create a Virtual Desktop Assistant just like Jarvis. I started searching on youtube
                and statrted to learn <b>Python</b> in <b>2020</b> because most tutorials were based on Python. But that
                did not go well because due to some reasons I almost quit programming and it seemed like I am not
                made for this.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about column animated-element">
            <img src="images/image_03.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                But then I made myself again and completed the task of succesfully creating a Desktop
                Assistant that did some basic tasks using python. Most people ask why i didn't continue it was because
                at that time I knew i don't want this to be my career not because it was tough but I can't also tell an
                absolute reason it was more of a hunch. But at the same time I wanted to be aligned to coding industry
                as well.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about animated-element">
            <img src="images/image_02.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Then I started to learn about different feilds that are in this industry like App Development, Graphic
                Design And
                Web Development. After studying and analyzing each feild for sometime I chose Web Development. And Thus
                started a
                beautiful which is still going on, but I remember when made my first page which did nothing but showed
                my intrests
                and could redirect me to other websites.But it was just starting of a never ending journey.
